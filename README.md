# Quizzer

A mini quizlet experience (Check releases for the game)

#This is a mini quizzing app I've created over the weekend in ue5 to replace flashcards when studying 

#The project files are available for anyone to mess around with so have at it! https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_uy-65hnhDF2VEmUHxTUcf3QdoPgGla2/view?usp=share_link
-I would add them here on github but the file size is too large.
